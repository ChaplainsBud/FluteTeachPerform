# FluteTeachPerform

Elevator Pitch: Educated and trained musicians sustain business during the pandemic by an online presence.

Some may even make more money as the troubled seek consolation in digital media -- Netflix, 

Video Games, etc. The obstacle of joining the online market is taken away by putting the burden of

development, deployment, and maintanance on us.

 *I think the first part would be "define the product goals, scope, and create a backlog of user stories"

Followed by develop a demonstrable prototype of the solution with the top N% of stories completed.

The only aspects of agile/scrum  you need for now is a backlog of user stories, and a series of sprints where you identify a set of stories in advance of each sprint.  At the end of the sprint if you want to deliver the sprint demo I'd be happy to view it.*

VIII. Add a JavaScript game, Mooncake configuration, then actor in a narrative of escaping Beijing kids
during a Lunar Moon festival. 

*This game is advertising for our mooncake company, something I get to put on each musician's site in exchange
for building and hosting it for them.
