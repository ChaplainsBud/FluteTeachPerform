 *I think the first part would be "define the product goals, scope, and create a backlog of user stories"

Followed by develop a demonstrable prototype of the solution with the top N% of stories completed.

The only aspects of agile/scrum  you need for now is a backlog of user stories, and a series of sprints where you identify a set of stories in advance of each sprint.  At the end of the sprint if you want to deliver the sprint demo I'd be happy to view it.*
